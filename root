This seems to dramatically improve the\n  speed for simple keys. Thank Zilong Tan for the suggestion. Reference:\n  - http://code.google.com/p/ulib/\n  - http://nothings.org/computer/judy/\n- Allow to optionally use linear probing which usually has better\n  performance for random input. Double hashing is still the default as it\n  is more robust to certain non-random input.","files":null}]}
