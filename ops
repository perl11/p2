(SEGV)\nI changed in branch `gc` the munmap to mprotect read-only. Maybe we need to relink the fwd pointers on such objects to skip over ptr in old_birth region.\n\n2nd during long-lived processes potion_fwd with POTION_COPIED objects appear (gc major). Not sure if they are valid after the mark major phase.\n\nNeed to change potion_fwd to check for it also if so, and need to change all object accessors to use potion_fwd (similar to PN_TUPLE()).","files":null}]}
