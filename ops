I used \"time\" command to time it and found it to be 6 times faster than running on perl. \n\nWish perl could have a restricted mode where we lose sometime (like be able to change the variable type after it's initialization) and gains lots of speed.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"ba1625a6608e712ded2a67f4a8029f0ddc5b0159"},"timestamp":1479730173,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTkyMDM2NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/p2/issues/29#issuecomment-261920364"},"message":"perl5 is not really optimizable without a total rewrite. It's not only the bad optree and vm run-time design, it's also the data structures and the memory refcounting scheme. even with a better optree as in ruby or python you don't get much more speed.\n\nsee the cperl docs and todo list.
